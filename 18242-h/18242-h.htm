<h3>Behind the Arras</h3>

<table>
<tr><td>
<p class = "firstline">
<span class = "firstword"><span class = "firstletter">I</span>
like</span> the old house tolerably well,</p>
<p class = "nospace">
Where I must dwell</p>
<p class = "verse">
Like a familiar gnome;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And yet I never shall feel quite at home:</p>
<p class = "verse">
I love to roam.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Day after day I loiter and explore</p>
<p class = "verse">
From door to door;</p>
<p class = "verse">
So many treasures lure</p>
<p class = "verse">
The curious mind. What histories obscure</p>
<p class = "verse">
They must immure!</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I hardly know which room I care for best;</p>
<p class = "verse">
This fronting west,</p>
<p class = "verse">
With the strange hills in view,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Where the great sun goes,&mdash;where I may go too,</p>
<p class = "verse">
When my lease is through,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Or this one for the morning and the east,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Where a man may feast</p>
<p class = "verse">
His eyes on looming sails,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And be the first to catch their foreign hails</p>
<p class = "verse">
Or spy their bales.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
Then the pale summer twilights towards the pole!</p>
<p class = "verse">
It thrills my soul</p>
<p class = "verse">
With wonder and delight,</p>
<p class = "verse">
When gold-green shadows walk the world at night,</p>
<p class = "verse">
So still, so bright.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
There at the window many a time of year,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Strange faces peer,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Solemn though not unkind,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Their wits in search of something left behind</p>
<p class = "verse">
Time out of mind;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
As if they once had lived here, and stole back</p>
<p class = "verse">
To the window crack</p>
<p class = "verse">
For a peep which seems to say,</p>
<p class = "verse">
&ldquo;Good fortune, brother, in your house of clay!&rdquo;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And then, &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I hear their footsteps on the gravel walk,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Their scraps of talk,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And hurrying after, reach</p>
<p class = "verse">
Only the crazy sea-drone of the beach</p>
<p class = "verse">
In endless speech.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
And often when the autumn noons are still,</p>
<p class = "verse">
By swale and hill</p>
<p class = "verse">
I see their gipsy signs,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Trespassing somewhere on my border lines;</p>
<p class = "verse">
With what designs?</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I forth afoot; but when I reach the place,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Hardly a trace,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Save the soft purple haze</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of smouldering camp-fires, any hint betrays</p>
<p class = "verse">
Who went these ways.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Or tatters of pale aster blue, descried</p>
<p class = "verse">
By the roadside,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Reveal whither they fled;</p>
<p class = "verse">
Or the swamp maples, here and there a shred</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of Indian red.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
But most of all, the marvellous tapestry</p>
<p class = "verse">
Engrosses me,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Where such strange things are rife,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Fancies of beasts and flowers, and love and strife,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Woven to the life;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Degraded shapes and splendid seraph forms,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And teeming swarms</p>
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4"> </a>
<p class = "verse">
Of creatures gauzy dim</p>
<p class = "verse">
That cloud the dusk, and painted fish that swim,</p>
<p class = "verse">
At the weaver&rsquo;s whim;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
And wonderful birds that wheel and hang in the air;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And beings with hair,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And moving eyes in the face,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And white bone teeth and hideous grins, who race</p>
<p class = "verse">
From place to place;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
They build great temples to their John-a-nod,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And fume and plod</p>
<p class = "verse">
To deck themselves with gold,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And paint themselves like chattels to be sold,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Then turn to mould.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Sometimes they seem almost as real as I;</p>
<p class = "verse">
I hear them sigh;</p>
<p class = "verse">
I see them bow with grief,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Or dance for joy like an aspen leaf;</p>
<p class = "verse">
But that is brief.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
They have mad wars and phantom marriages;</p>
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5"> </a>
<p class = "verse">
Nor seem to guess</p>
<p class = "verse">
There are dimensions still,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Beyond thought&rsquo;s reach, though not beyond love&rsquo;s will,</p>
<p class = "verse">
For soul to fill.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
And some I call my friends, and make believe</p>
<p class = "verse">
Their spirits grieve,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Brood, and rejoice with mine;</p>
<p class = "verse">
I talk to them in phrases quaint and fine</p>
<p class = "verse">
Over the wine;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I tell them all my secrets; touch their hands;</p>
<p class = "verse">
One understands</p>
<p class = "verse">
Perhaps. How hard he tries</p>
<p class = "verse">
To speak! And yet those glorious mild eyes,</p>
<p class = "verse">
His best replies!</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I even have my cronies, one or two,</p>
<p class = "verse">
My cherished few.</p>
<p class = "verse">
But ah, they do not stay!</p>
<p class = "verse">
For the sun fades them and they pass away,</p>
<p class = "verse">
As I grow gray.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Yet while they last how actual they seem!</p>
<p class = "verse">
Their faces beam;</p>
<p class = "verse">
I give them all their names,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6"> </a>
<p class = "verse">
Bertram and Gilbert, Louis, Frank and James,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Each with his aims;</p>
<p class = "verse">
One thinks he is a poet, and writes verse</p>
<p class = "verse">
His friends rehearse;</p>
<p class = "verse">
Another is full of law;</p>
<p class = "verse">
A third sees pictures which his hand can draw</p>
<p class = "verse">
Without a flaw.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Strangest of all, they never rest. Day long</p>
<p class = "verse">
They shift and throng,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Moved by invisible will,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Like a great breath which puffs across my sill,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And then is still;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
It shakes my lovely manikins on the wall;</p>
<p class = "verse">
Squall after squall,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Gust upon crowding gust,</p>
<p class = "verse">
It sweeps them willy nilly like blown dust</p>
<p class = "verse">
With glory or lust.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
It is the world-ghost, the time-spirit, come</p>
<p class = "verse">
None knows where from,</p>
<p class = "verse">
The viewless draughty tide</p>
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7"> </a>
<p class = "verse">
And wash of being. I hear it yaw and glide,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And then subside,</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Along these ghostly corridors and halls</p>
<p class = "verse">
Like faint footfalls;</p>
<p class = "verse">
The hangings stir in the air;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And when I start and challenge, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p class = "verse">
It answers, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
The wail and sob and moan of the sea&rsquo;s dirge,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Its plangor and surge;</p>
<p class = "verse">
The awful biting sough</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of drifted snows along some arctic bluff,</p>
<p class = "verse">
That veer and luff,</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
And have the vacant boding human cry,</p>
<p class = "verse">
As they go by;&mdash;</p>
<p class = "verse">
Is it a banished soul</p>
<p class = "verse">
Dredging the dark like a distracted mole</p>
<p class = "verse">
Under a knoll?</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Like some invisible henchman old and gray,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Day after day</p>
<p class = "verse">
I hear it come and go,</p>
<p class = "verse">
With stealthy swift unmeaning to and fro,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Muttering low,</p>

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
Ceaseless and daft and terrible and blind,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Like a lost mind.</p>
<p class = "verse">
I often chill with fear</p>
<p class = "verse">
When I bethink me, What if it should peer</p>
<p class = "verse">
At my shoulder here!</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Perchance he drives the merry-go-round whose track</p>
<p class = "verse">
Is the zodiac;</p>
<p class = "verse">
His name is No-man&rsquo;s-friend;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And his gabbling parrot-talk has neither trend,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Beginning, nor end.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
A prince of madness too, I&rsquo;d cry, &ldquo;A rat!&rdquo;</p>
<p class = "verse">
And lunge thereat,&mdash;</p>
<p class = "verse">
Let out at one swift thrust</p>
<p class = "verse">
The cunning arch-delusion of the dust</p>
<p class = "verse">
I so mistrust,</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
But that I fear I should disclose a face</p>
<p class = "verse">
Wearing the trace</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of my own human guise,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Piteous, unharmful, loving, sad, and wise,</p>
<p class = "verse">
With the speaking eyes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
I would the house were rid of his grim pranks,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Moaning from banks</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of pine trees in the moon,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Startling the silence like a demoniac loon</p>
<p class = "verse">
At dead of noon,</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Or whispering his fool-talk to the leaves</p>
<p class = "verse">
About my eaves.</p>
<p class = "verse">
And yet how can I know</p>
<p class = "verse">
&rsquo;T is not a happy Ariel masking so</p>
<p class = "verse">
In mocking woe?</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Then with a little broken laugh I say,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Snatching away</p>
<p class = "verse">
The curtain where he grinned</p>
<p class = "verse">
(My feverish sight thought) like a sin unsinned,</p>
<p class = "verse">
&ldquo;Only the wind!&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Yet often too he steals so softly by,</p>
<p class = "verse">
With half a sigh,</p>
<p class = "verse">
I deem he must be mild,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Fair as a woman, gentle as a child,</p>
<p class = "verse">
And forest wild.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
Passing the door where an old wind-harp swings,</p>
<p class = "verse">
With its five strings,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Contrived long years ago</p>
<p class = "verse">
By my first predecessor bent to show</p>
<p class = "verse">
His handcraft so,</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
He lays his fingers on the &aelig;olian wire,</p>
<p class = "verse">
As a core of fire</p>
<p class = "verse">
Is laid upon the blast</p>
<p class = "verse">
To kindle and glow and fill the purple vast</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of dark at last.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
Weird wise and low, piercing and keen and glad,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Or dim and sad</p>
<p class = "verse">
As a forgotten strain</p>
<p class = "verse">
Born when the broken legions of the rain</p>
<p class = "verse">
Swept through the plain&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
He plays, like some dread veiled mysteriarch,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Lighting the dark,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Bidding the spring grow warm,</p>
<p class = "verse">
The gendering merge and loosing of spirit in form,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Peace out of storm.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11"> </a>
<p class = "verse firstline">
For music is the sacrament of love;</p>
<p class = "verse">
He broods above</p>
<p class = "verse">
The virgin silence, till</p>
<p class = "verse">
She yields for rapture shuddering, yearning still</p>
<p class = "verse">
To his sweet will.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I hear him sing, &ldquo;Your harp is like a mesh,</p>

Woven of flesh</p>

And spread within the shoal</p>
<p class = "verse">
Of life, where runs the tide-race of the soul</p>
<p class = "verse">
In my control.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
&ldquo;Though my wild way may ruin what it bends,</p>
<p class = "verse">
It makes amends</p>
<p class = "verse">
To the frail downy clocks,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Telling their seed a secret that unlocks</p>
<p class = "verse">
The granite rocks.</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
&ldquo;The womb of silence to the crave sound</p>

Is heaven unfound,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Till I, to soothe and slake</p>
<p class = "verse">
Being&rsquo;s most utter and imperious ache,</p>

Bid rhythm awake.</p>

I shall go hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "verse firstline">
I need no more to guess the weaver&rsquo;s name,</p>

Who hung each hall and room</p>

With swarthy-tinged vermilion upon gloom;</p>

I know that loom.</p>

Give me a little space and time enough,</p>

O men and women in that rich design,</p>
<p class = "verse">
Sleep-soft, sun-fine,</p>

Dew-tenuous and free,</p>

A tone of the infinite wind-themes of the sea,</p>

Borne in to me,</p>

Reveals how you were woven to the might</p>

The morning&rsquo;s rim;</p>

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
